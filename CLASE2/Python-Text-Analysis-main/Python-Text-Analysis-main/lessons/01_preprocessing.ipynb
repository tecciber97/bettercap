NLP is a field that deals with identifying and extracting patterns of language, primarily in written texts. Throughout the workshop series, we'll interact with various packages for performing text analysis: starting from simple string methods to specific NLP packages, such as `nltk`, `spaCy`, and more recent ones on Large Language Models (`BERT`).\n",

    "- Remove punctuation marks\n",
    "- Remove extra whitespace characters\n",
    "- Remove stop words\n",

    "## Tokenizers Since LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen what tokenization looks like with two widely-used NLP packages. They work quite well in some settings, but not others. Recall that `nltk` struggles with URLs. Now, imagine the data we have is even messier, containing misspellings, recently coined words, foreign names, and etc (collectively called \"out of vocabulary\" or OOV words). In such circumstances, we might need a more powerful model to handle these complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, tokenization schemes change substantially with **Large Language Models** (LLMs), which are models trained on an enormous amount of data from mixed sources. With that magnitude of data, LLMs are better at chunking a longer sequence into tokens and tokens into **subtokens**. These subtokens can be morphological units of a word, such as an affix, but they can also be parts of a word where the model sets a \"meaningful\" boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate tokenization in **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which utilizes a tokenization algorithm called [**WordPiece**](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/6). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will load the tokenizer of BERT from the package `transformers`, which hosts a number of Transformer-based LLMs (e.g., BERT). We won't go into the architecture of Transformer in this workshop, but feel free to check out the D-lab workshop on [GPT Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/GPT-Fundamentals)!"
